# DSA-Project

> The project involved building a suduko solver.  

Opensource Libraries Used: pygame (www.pygame.org)  
Instructions: pygame can be install by writing `pip install pygame` into cmd  

Run the gui.py file to load the program. There are three main buttons:
1. 'Load Test Case 1' — displays an example sudoku puzzle to solve
2. 'Reset' — sets the board back to the default state i.e all 0's
3. 'Go!' — solves the puzzle or test case inputed

Custom puzzles can be entered by clicking each cell and inputting a number from 1-9. Then, hit go to solve.
